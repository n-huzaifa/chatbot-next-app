[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8e7afed6-8e28-4eb7-b321-7034420cab58/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/system-architecture-chatbot/deploys)

## Summary

This project is a simple chatbot built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. The chatbot provides responses to common questions about software architecture and design patterns. It allows users to interact with the chatbot by typing their questions or selecting predefined questions from a list of response buttons.

## Live Site

The chatbot is live and accessible at [system-architecture-chatbot.netlify.app](https://system-architecture-chatbot.netlify.app/)âœ¨

## How to Use

To use the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your local development environment.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the chatbot.

The chatbot interface will be displayed, allowing you to interact with it. You can type your questions directly into the input field and press "Send" to receive responses. Alternatively, you can click on the predefined response buttons to select a question and receive an immediate response.

The chat history will be displayed below the input field, showing both the user's questions and the chatbot's responses. The responses are predefined in the responses object, which maps specific questions to their corresponding answers.

Feel free to extend or modify the responses object to include more questions and answers according to your needs. You can also customize the chatbot's appearance by modifying the CSS classes and styles in the code.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the project.

## Conclusion

The System Design and Architecture Chatbot project provides a starting point for building a chatbot that can answer questions related to software architecture and design patterns. You can use this project as a foundation and enhance it with additional features or integrate it into your existing applications.
